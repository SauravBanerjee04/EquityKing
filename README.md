## üîß How It Works

### Core Components

1. **PokerGame Class**: Main game controller
2. **Card Management**: Handles deck creation, shuffling, and dealing
3. **Equity Calculation**: Uses `treys` library for accurate probability calculation
4. **Hand Evaluation**: Professional-grade poker hand ranking
5. **User Interface**: Interactive command-line interface

### Equity Calculation

The game uses the `treys` library for equity calculation:

- **Incomplete Board** (Flop/Turn): Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 iterations
- **Complete Board** (River): Exact calculation using all possible hand combinations
- **Hand Evaluation**: 7-card to 5-card hand evaluation for optimal hand selection

### Card Format

- **Input Format**: `'AH'` (Ace of Hearts), `'KD'` (King of Diamonds)
- **Internal Conversion**: Converts to treys format (`'Ah'`, `'Kd'`) for evaluation
- **Display**: Shows cards in readable format

## üìä Learning Benefits

- **Improve Equity Estimation**: Practice guessing hand probabilities
- **Understand Hand Strength**: Learn relative hand rankings
- **Develop Intuition**: Build poker instincts through repeated practice
- **Study Board Texture**: Analyze how community cards affect equity
- **Practice Decision Making**: Make fold/call decisions based on equity

## üéØ Tips for Better Play

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with 2-3 players to focus on basic equity concepts

3. **Practice Regularly**: Consistent practice improves estimation accuracy
4. **Analyze Mistakes**: Pay attention to where your guesses differ most from true equity
5. **Consider Position**: Think about how position affects hand strength

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

```bash
pip install treys
```

**Virtual Environment Not Activated:**
```bash
source pokerenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: pokerenv\Scripts\activate
```

**Invalid Player Count:**
